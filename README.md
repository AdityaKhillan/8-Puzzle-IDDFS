# 8-Puzzle-IDDFS

The project implements two different versions of the function for the 8 puzzle: one that copies and edits the data structure for the parent node s and one that modifies the parent state directly (undoing the modifications as needed). The algorithm used to solve the 8 puzzle is iterative deepening depth-first search that use these functions and compare their performance.
