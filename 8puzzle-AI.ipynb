        "The code starts by creating a node object with the initial state and assigns it to the variable node. Then, it enters a loop that iterates over a range of depth values. This is the iterative deepening part of the algorithm, where each iteration increases the depth limit of the search.\n",

        "If the current node is not a goal state and its depth is less than the depth limit of the current iteration, the algorithm generates its children using the get_children function, and for each child, it applies the modify_parent_state function twice. This function modifies the state of the child by updating its parent reference to the current node and increasing its cost by one. It also undoes the modifications when it is called a second time.\n",
